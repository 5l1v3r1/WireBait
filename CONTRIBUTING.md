# How can I contribute?
This project is "young" and right now I would need people to give me feed back. 
If you have dissectors, you can use the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/MarkoPaul0/WireBait#quick_start) 
to see if you can get them to run without wireshark.
From there please feel free to create an issue if you want to report a bug or even ask questions.
